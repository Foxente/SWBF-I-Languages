# SWBF-I-Languages
It is the languages for [SWBF I The Sith Launcher](https://github.com/Foxente/SWBF-I-The-Sith-Launcher)  
Everyone can add their own national language.  
### Installing of this packs:
1) Download this repository.
2) Move all repository content to LauncherData\Languages
### Adding of new language pack:
1) You must copy English folder and change new folder's name for your language.
2) Now, for editing language for launcher you can edit Language.ini. I recommend doing this in Notepad++. You must use **UTF-8** only!
3) For editing game language run EditLanguage.exe and edit lines which you wants.  
Warnings:  
1) Any file "english.cfg" can not be renamed. It is game condition for reading core.lvl.  
2) Standart english.cfg file doesn't have a lot of language values, because Battlefront.exe has many own english default values. So you can take missing parts from other language packs.

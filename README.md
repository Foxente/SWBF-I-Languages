Everyone can add their own national language.  
#Adding of new language pack:
1) You must copy English folder and change new folder's name for your language.
2) Now, for editing language for launcher you can edit Language.ini. I recommend doing this in Notepad++. You must use **UTF-8** only!
3) For editing game language... (will be in future)
